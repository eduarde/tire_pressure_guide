#  Tire Pressure Recommndation tool

A comprehensive bicycle tire pressure recommendation system that provides optimal pressure calculations based on rider weight, bike specifications, tire dimensions, and riding conditions.

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

Getting tire pressure right is crucial for performance, comfort, and safety. Too high and you sacrifice grip and comfort; too low and you risk pinch flats and sluggish handling. This tool takes the guesswork out of tire pressure by using a scientifically-validated algorithm that accounts for multiple factors affecting optimal pressure.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Calculates optimal tire pressure based on your specific setup
- **Multiple Disciplines**: Supports road cycling, gravel, cyclocross, and mountain biking (XC, trail, enduro, downhill)
- **Comprehensive Parameters**: Considers rider weight, bike weight, tire width, rim width, rim type, tire casing, and surface conditions
- **Realistic Results**: Produces accurate pressure recommendations that match real-world best practices
- **FastAPI Backend**: RESTful API for easy integration into applications
- **Built with Pydantic**: Type-safe data validation and serialization

### Example Request

```python
import requests

data = {
    "ride_type": {
        "style": "ROAD",
        "surface": "DRY"
    },
    "weight": {
        "rider": 75.0,
        "bike": 8.0
    },
    "front_tire": {
        "position": "FRONT",
        "casing": "STANDARD",
        "width": 28.0,
        "unit": "MM"
    },
    "rear_tire": {
        "position": "REAR",
        "casing": "STANDARD",
        "width": 28.0,
        "unit": "MM"
    },
    "front_wheel": {
        "position": "FRONT",
        "diameter": "700C",
        "rim_type": "HOOKLESS",
        "rim_width": 21.0
    },
    "rear_wheel": {
        "position": "REAR",
        "diameter": "700C",
        "rim_type": "HOOKLESS",
        "rim_width": 21.0
    }
}

response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/calculate", json=data)
print(response.json())
```

Expected output:
```json
{
    "front_wheel": 50.2,
    "rear_wheel": 53.4,
    "unit": "PSI"
}
```

## ðŸ§® Algorithm

The tire pressure calculator uses an empirically-derived formula that considers:

1. **Geometric Factors**: Tire volume based on tire width and wheel diameter
2. **Weight Distribution**: Total system weight (rider + bike) with front/rear balance
3. **Ride Style Modifiers**: Adjustments for road, gravel, cyclocross, and mountain biking disciplines
4. **Equipment Factors**: 
   - Rim type (hookless, hooked, tubular, tubes)
   - Tire casing (standard, reinforced, thin)
   - Rim width adjustments
5. **Conditions**: Surface type (dry, wet, mixed, snow)

The algorithm produces pressures that optimize:
- Rolling resistance
- Comfort and vibration damping
- Cornering grip
- Puncture resistance
